# You all have used the random library of python. You have seen in the screen-cast of how powerful it is.
# In this assignment, you will sort a list let's say list_1 of numbers in increasing order using the random library.
#
# Following are the steps to sort the numbers using the random library.
#
# Step 1: Import the randint definition of the random library of python. Check this page if you want some help.
#
# Step 2: Take the elements of the list_1 as input.
#
# Step 3: randomly choose two indexes i and j within the range of the size of list_1.
#
# Step 4: Swap the elements present at the indexes i and j. After doing this, check whether the list_1 is sorted or not.
#
# Step 5: Repeat step 3 and 4 until the array is not sorted.
#
# Input Format:
# The first line contains a single number n which signifies the number of elements in the list_1.
# From the second line, the elements of the list_1 are given with each number in a new line.
#
# Output Format:
# Print the elements of the list_1 in a single line with each element separated by a space.
# NOTE 1: There should not be any space after the last element.
# Example:
#
# Input:
# 4
# 3
# 1
# 2
# 5
#
# Output:
# 1 2 3 5
#
# Explanation:
# The first line of the input is 4. Which means that n is 4, or the number of elements in list_1 is 4. The elements of list_1 are 3, 1, 2, 5 in this order.
# The sorted version of this list is 1 2 3 5, which is the output.
#
# NOTE 2: There are many ways to sort the elements of a list. The purpose of this assignment is to show the power of randomness, and obviously it's fun.
