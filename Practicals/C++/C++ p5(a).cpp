//Imagine a publishing company that markets both book and audiocassette versions of its works. Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of a publication. From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int), and tape, which adds a playing time in minutes (type float). Each of these three classes should have a getdata() function to get its data from the user at the keyboard, and a putdata() function to display its data.
