//Create a class that imitates part of the functionality of the basic data type int. Call the class Int(note different spelling). The only data in this class is an int variable. Include member functions to initialize an Int to 0, to initialize it to an int value, to display it (it looks just like an int), and use operator overloading to add two Int values. Write a program that exercises this class by creating two initialized and one uninitialized Int values, adding these two initialized values and placing the response in the uninitialized value, and then displaying this result
