#
# EXPLANATION of the above:
#
# This example is the same as the previous example except for:
#   -- There is an Entry box in which the human user can enter a string.
#   -- There is a function called   print_contents   that
#        takes an ARGUMENT that is expected to be a ttk.Entry.
#   -- The LAMBDA expression defines a function that calls
#        the   print_contents   function, sending it the Entry box
#        made a few lines above the lambda function as an argument.
#   -- Hence, the Button can do stuff with the CONTENTS of the Entry box.
#
# To make a Button respond to a button-press by doing things with
#   the CONTENTS of an ENTRY box:
#
#   1. Set a value to the Button's 'command' attribute,
#        as described in the previous module.  For example:
#
#           button1['command'] = ...
#
#   2. Use a LAMBDA expression to express WHAT the Button should do
#      when pressed, as described in the previous module.  For example:
#
#           button1['command'] = (lambda:
#                                 foo(...))
#
#   3. Construct and display a ttk.Entry prior to telling Button
#        what its command is:
#
#           entry1 = ttk.Entry(frame1)
#
#   4. Make the body of the lambda expression (that is, the function
#        that the lambda function calls when the lambda function
#        is executed) take the ttk.Entry as an ARGUMENT.  For example:
#
#           entry1 = ttk.Entry(frame1)
#           button1['command'] = (lambda:
#                                 foo(entry1))
#   5. The function that the lambda function calls when the lambda
#        function is executed can use the given Entry box to access
#        the CONTENTS of the Entry box using its  GET  method.
#        For example:
#
#            def foo(entry_box):
#                s = entry_box.get()
#
#
# Do not confuse the Entry box:
#    -- the ttk.Entry widget that is displayed and into which the human
#       user can type stuff
#
# with the CONTENTS of the Entry box:
#    -- which is accessed via the Entry box's   get   method, as in:
#          entry_box.get()
#
# Do not forget that   entry_box.get()   returns the contents of the
# Entry box
#    ** at the TIME that the   entry_box.get()   expression runs. **
#
# Do not forget that   entry_box.get()   returns a STRING.
#    -- If the string represents an INTEGER, then the   int  function
#       returns the INTEGER that the STRING REPRESENTS.  For example:
#
#                contents = entry_box.get()
#                n = int(contents)
#       makes   n   be an integer if the human typed an integer
#       into the Entry box.
#
#       Likewise, the   float   function returns the floating point
#       number that the string represents.
